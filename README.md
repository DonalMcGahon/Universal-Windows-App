## Module Project â€“ 60% Weighting
### Create a Windows 10 UWP App. The application should incorporate the following elements:
* A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and
this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State
Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.
* A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose. User Experience should be carefully
considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent
across devices.
* Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written
in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.
* Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach.

## Windows Universal App Description
* This Windows Universal App is called Medicine Tracker.
* The idea behind the application is to allow users of the app to keep track of when they have to take their medication or when to give medication to others.
* The user is greated with a login page once they open the app. They will have to navigate to the register page and enter a username, password and email (optional) to register to the app.
* They then can use those details to login.
* The user can enter details about medication for example who's it for, time to be taken and date to be taken.
* This information is stored on the cloud platform Azure.
* The user can navigate to medication page by using the hambuger view and there will be all the information they entered.
* Once they have taken or given the medication, they can tick it off by ticking the checkbox beside each entry.
* The user can also add appointments to their calender on their machine.
* They can enter an appointment name, location, details, time and date and all this information is stored onto there calendar on the machine they are using.
